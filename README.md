I am a masters student in the Robotics Engineering program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

Previously, I worked at Skylark Drones, where I was developing pipelines for solving computer vision problems associated with drone surveys. I was also the primary backend developer for Drone Mission Ops, the proprietary software for managing commercial drone operations.

I am interested in the areas of motion planning & visual perception.
