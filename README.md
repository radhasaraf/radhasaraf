I currently work on SLAM at Unison, a VR headset startup based in Mountain View. 

I completed master's in Robotics Engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) in December 2023.

Spent my 2nd year of master's working at Skydio and Humane as a computer vision intern.

Earlier, I worked at Skylark Drones, solving computer vision problems associated with drone surveys. I was also the primary backend developer for Drone Mission Ops, the proprietary software for managing commercial drone operations.

I am interested in the areas of motion planning & visual perception.
